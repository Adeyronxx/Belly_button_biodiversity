# INTRODUCTION
In this project we made use of data samples for different bacterias found in the belly button. We were able to visualize the data samples for each candidate and were further able to narrow our data down to determine the top 10 bacterial speecies found in the belly button.

# RESULTS
1. A bar chart showing the top 10 bacterial specie with the input of any individuals ID.

2. A bubble chart showing the top bacterial specie for individual ids.

3. A gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value and the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

# Conclusion

In conclusion each individual data is properly outlined that if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
